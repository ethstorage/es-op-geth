    - title: "Soul Gas Token modifications"
      description: |
        When charging gas, the EVM is extended to first charge from the Soul Gas Token (which is a soul bounded ERC20) balance;
        Then charge from the native balance if it's not enough.

        The txpool and gas estimator are also extended to use the sum of native balance and Soul Gas Token balance as the effective balance.

        In order to fix a compatibility [issue](https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism/issues/148) with wallets, the node is
        also extended to listen to another http port alongside the default one, the only different is that the `eth_GetBalance` API
        will return the sum of native balance and Soul Gas Token balance.

    - title: "L2 Blob modifications"
      description: |
        The txpool is extended to allow blob transaction is l2 blob is enabled.

        The block-building code (in the "miner" package because of Proof-Of-Work legacy of ethereum) is extended to ensure that,
        for blob transactions, the blobs are required when it's sequencing, but not required when it's deriving.

        We also charge a minimum data-availability fee for each blob.

    - title: "Custom Gas Token modification"
      description: |
        As we're using the QKC token (which is an ERC20 token) on L1 as the gas token, the `RPCTxFeeCap` is changed from 1 to 1000.
